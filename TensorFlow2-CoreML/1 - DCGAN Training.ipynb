    "# TensorFlow 2 GAN -> CoreML Notebook, Part 1\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook trains a TensorFlow 2 color image generative adversarial network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also included are some fun plotting functions for exploring / animating the latent space.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dependencies, Installation and Environment\n",
    "To run this you'll need a Python 3 environment with **TensorFlow 2**:\n",
    "- tensorflow or tensorflow-gpu 2+ (GPU highly recommended. I'm currently running tensorflow-gpu version 2.2.0)\n",
    "- matplotlib\n",
    "- numpy\n",
    "- jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do use a GPU, you can test it by running:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import tensorflow as tf\n",
    "print(\"Num GPUs Available: \", len(tf.config.experimental.list_physical_devices('GPU')))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Model, Training, and Configuration\n",
    "This model is going to run on a wide variety of iPhones, so for simplicity we'll start with a deep convolutional network ([DCGAN](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/generative/dcgan)).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a lot of known issues that arise training GANs, but in these experiments I've been mostly concerned with (1) image quality and (2) \"mode collapse\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Image quality is pretty subjective. I'm looking to make pictures that are *close enough* to input images, and which are free of any weird artifacts or patterns (e.g. [checkerboarding](https://distill.pub/2016/deconv-checkerboard/)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Mode collapse occurs when the generator overfits and starts producing the same output over and over.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm generating artsy images from very small datasets: currently on the order of 500-20000 training samples. For my purposes, I've found that the models defined below tend to reach a happy place around 200-400 training epochs. You'll need to inspect the generated images and see what works for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a simple notebook, and there's much, much more that could be done to improve training performance. Some next steps might include changing up the loss function, or adding evaluation metrics like Fréchet Inception Distance. For more detailed writeups, see: [Common Problems (with GANs)](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/gan/problems), [10 Lessons I Learned Training GANs for one Year](https://towardsdatascience.com/10-lessons-i-learned-training-generative-adversarial-networks-gans-for-a-year-c9071159628), and [How to Train a GAN? Tips and tricks to make GANs work](https://github.com/soumith/ganhacks).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're looking to incorporate labels or want some control over inputs in the latent space, check out Conditional GAN (CGAN) and Information Maximizing GAN (InfoGAN).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting started\n",
    "The basic architecture and training sections of this notebook are based on the [\"GAN overriding Model.train_step\"](https://keras.io/examples/generative/dcgan_overriding_train_step/) tutorial, which trains a deep convolutional GAN with TensorFlow 2 + Keras to generate black and white digits based on the MNIST dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model has been modified to output 128x128 RGB images. Read along for more details!"
